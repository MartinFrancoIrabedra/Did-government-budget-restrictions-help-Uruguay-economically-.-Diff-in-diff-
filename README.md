# Did government budget restrictions help Uruguay economically? (Diff-in-diff)

After the elections of 2019, the new elected government implemented a whole new law package called LUC (Ley de Urgente Consideraci√≥n) which included more strict budget values and reduced government spending. This was a way to tackle the fiscal deficit but did it really help? The pandemic played a role in the world economy which obviously affected Uruguay as well so improving any macroeconomical factor during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic was a major challenge. 
I opted to use a difference in differences study to estimate the effect of the intervention of the LUC.
The dependent variables used are Government budget value; government spending; inflation rate; and GDP growth.
ùëå st is the dependent variable outcome in period t. Subject is a dummy variable indicating the treatment group (Uruguay = 1) and the control group (Argentina = 0). 
After_Intervention is a dummy variable indicating pre (before July 2020 = 0) and post (after July 2020 = 1) intervention of the law LUC for month t. 
Finally, Subject * After_Intervention is a dummy variable indicating whether the outcome was observed in the treatment group (Uruguay = 1) and after the intervention (after July 2020=1), or not in any other case (=0).
